# tripmanager


Hello!
The installation instructions are:

Just run:

1. npm install

Then:

2. npm run dev

And look at:

3. localhost:8080

to see the application.

I have used Vue as FE framework (mainly because I wanted to learn it) and SCSS as CSS processor even though I tried to keep CSS to a minimum (so it could have been neglected).

Thank you very much for viewing!
